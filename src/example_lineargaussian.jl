# # Types
# We provide a number of filter types
# - `ParticleFilter`: This filter is simple to use and assumes that both dynamics noise and measurement noise are additive.
# - `AuxiliaryParticleFilter`: This filter is identical to `ParticleFilter`, but uses a slightly different proposal mechanism for new particles.
# - `AdvancedParticleFilter`: This filter gives you more flexibility, at the expense of having to define a few more functions. More instructions on this type below.
# - `KalmanFilter`. Is what you would expect. Has the same features as the particle filters, but is restricted to linear dynamics and gaussian noise.
# - `UnscentedKalmanFilter`. Is also what you would expect. Has almost the same features as the kalman filters, but handle nonlinear dynamics and measurement model, still requires an additive Gaussian noise model.

# # Functionality
# - Filtering
# - Smoothing
# - Parameter estimation using ML or PMMH (Particle Marginal Metropolis Hastings)

# # Usage example
# This example demostrates how we set up the filters, both PF and KF, for a simple linear system.

# ## Particle filter
# Defining a particle filter is straightforward, one must define the distribution of the noise `df` in the dynamics function, `dynamics(x,u)` and the noise distribution `dg` in the measurement function `measurement(x)`. The distribution of the initial state `d0` must also be provided. An example for a linear Gaussian system is given below.
using LowLevelParticleFilters, LinearAlgebra, StaticArrays, Distributions, Plots

# Define problem

n = 2   # Dimension of state
m = 2   # Dimension of input
p = 2   # Dimension of measurements
N = 500 # Number of particles

const dg = MvNormal(p,1.0)          # Measurement noise Distribution
const df = MvNormal(n,1.0)          # Dynamics noise Distribution
const d0 = MvNormal(randn(n),2.0)   # Initial state Distribution

# Define random linear state-space system
Tr = randn(n,n)
const A = SMatrix{n,n}(Tr*diagm(0=>LinRange(0.5,0.95,n))/Tr)
const B = @SMatrix randn(n,m)
const C = @SMatrix randn(p,n)

# The following two functions are required by the filter
dynamics(x,u) = A*x .+ B*u
measurement(x) = C*x
vecvec_to_mat(x) = copy(reduce(hcat, x)') # Helper function

# We are now ready to define and use a filter
pf = ParticleFilter(N, dynamics, measurement, df, dg, d0)
xs,u,y = simulate(pf,100,df) # We can simulate the model that the pf represents
pf(u[1], y[1]) # Perform one filtering step using input u and measurement y
particles(pf) # Query the filter for particles, try weights(pf) or expweights(pf) as well
x̂ = weigthed_mean(pf) # using the current state
# If you want to perform filtering using vectors of inputs and measurements, try any of the functions
x,w,we,ll = forward_trajectory(pf, u, y) # Filter whole vectors of signals
x̂,ll = mean_trajectory(pf, u, y)
trajectorydensity(pf,x,w,y,xreal=xs)
# ![window](figs/trajdens.png)

# If [MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl) is loaded, you may transform the output particles to `Matrix{MonteCarloMeasurements.Particles}` with the layout `T × n_states` using `Particles(x,we)`. Internally, the particles are then resampled such that they all have unit weight. This is conventient for making use of the [plotting facilities of MonteCarloMeasurements.jl](https://baggepinnen.github.io/MonteCarloMeasurements.jl/stable/#Plotting-1).

# For a full usage example, see the benchmark section below or [example_lineargaussian.jl](https://github.com/baggepinnen/LowLevelParticleFilters.jl/blob/master/src/example_lineargaussian.jl)


# # Smoothing
# We also provide a particle smoother, based on forward filtering, backward simulation (FFBS)

T     = 200 # Number of time steps
M     = 100 # Number of smoothed backwards trajectories
pf    = ParticleFilter(N, dynamics, measurement, df, dg, d0)
du    = MvNormal(2,1) # Control input distribution
x,u,y = simulate(pf,T,du) # Simulate trajectory using the model in the filter
tosvec(y) = reinterpret(SVector{length(y[1]),Float64}, reduce(hcat,y))[:] |> copy
x,u,y = tosvec.((x,u,y))

xb,ll = smooth(pf, M, u, y) # Sample smooting particles
xbm   = smoothed_mean(xb)   # Calculate the mean of smoothing trajectories
xbc   = smoothed_cov(xb)    # And covariance
xbt   = smoothed_trajs(xb)  # Get smoothing trajectories

# ![window](figs/smooth.png)

# # Kalman filter
# A Kalman filter is easily created using the constructor. Many of the functions defined for particle filters, are defined also for Kalman filters, e.g.:

eye(n) = Matrix{Float64}(I,n,n)
kf     = KalmanFilter(A, B, C, 0, eye(n), eye(p), MvNormal([1.,1.]))
ukf    = UnscentedKalmanFilter(dynamics, measurement, eye(n), eye(p), MvNormal([1.,1.]))
xf,xt,R,Rt,ll = forward_trajectory(kf, u, y) # filtered, prediction, pred cov, filter cov, loglik
xT,R,lls = smooth(kf, u, y) # Smoothed state, smoothed cov, loglik
# It can also be called in a loop like the `pf` above
#md for t = 1:T
#md     kf(u,y) # Performs both correct and predict!!
#md     ## alternatively
#md     ll += correct!(kf, y, t) # Returns loglik
#md     x   = state(kf)
#md     R   = covariance(kf)
#md     predict!(kf, u, t)
#md end

# # Troubleshooting
# Tuning a particle filter can be quite the challenge. To assist with this, we provide som visualization tools
debugplot(pf,u,y, runall=true, xreal=x) # does not work well with gr() as backend, try pyplot()

# Something seems to be off with this figure as the hottest spot is not really where we would expect it

# Optimization of the log likelihood can be done by, e.g., global/black box methods, see [BlackBoxOptim.jl](https://github.com/robertfeldt/BlackBoxOptim.jl). Standard tricks apply, such as performing the parameter search in log-space etc.


# ## Bayesian inference using PMMH
# This is pretty cool. We procede like we did for MAP above, but when calling the function `metropolis`, we will get the entire posterior distribution of the parameter vector, for the small cost of a massive increase in computational cost.

# # AdvancedParticleFilter
# The `AdvancedParticleFilter` type requires you to implement the same functions as the regular `ParticleFilter`, but in this case you also need to handle sampling from the noise distributions yourself.
# The function `dynamics` must have a method signature like below. It must provide one method that accepts state vector, control vector, time and `noise::Bool` that indicates whether or not to add noise to the state. If noise should be added, this should be done inside `dynamics` An example is given below
function dynamics(x,u,t,noise=false) # It's important that this defaults to false
    x = A*x .+ B*u # A simple dynamics model
    if noise
        x += rand(df)
    end
    x
end
# The `measurement_likelihood` function must have a method accepting state, measurement and time, and returning the log-likelihood of the measurement given the state, a simple example below:
function measurement_likelihood(x,y,t)
    logpdf(dg, C*x-y) # A simple linear measurement model with normal additive noise
end
# This gives you very high flexibility. The noise model in either function can, for instance, be a function of the state, something that is not possible for the simple `ParticleFilter`
# To be able to simulate the `AdvancedParticleFilter` like we did with the simple filter above, the `measurement` method with the signature `measurement(x,t,noise=false)` must be available and return a sample measurement given state (and possibly time). For our example measurement model above, this would look like this
measurement(x,t,noise=false) = C*x + noise*rand(dg)
# We now create the `AdvancedParticleFilter` and use it in the same way as the other filters:
apf = AdvancedParticleFilter(N, dynamics, measurement, measurement_likelihood, df, d0)
x,w,we,ll = forward_trajectory(apf, u, y)
trajectorydensity(apf, x, we, y, xreal=xs)

# We can even use this type as an AuxiliaryParticleFilter
apfa = AuxiliaryParticleFilter(apf)
x,w,we,ll = forward_trajectory(apfa, u, y)
trajectorydensity(apfa, x, we, y, xreal=xs)
dimensiondensity(apfa, x, we, y, 1, xreal=xs) # Same as above, but only plots a single dimension

# # High performance Distributions
# When `using LowLevelParticleFilters`, a number of methods related to distributions are defined for static arrays, making `logpdf` etc. faster. We also provide a new kind of distribution: `TupleProduct <: MultivariateDistribution` that behaves similarly to the `Product` distribution. The `TupleProduct` however stores the individual distributions in a tuple, has compile-time known length and supports `Mixed <: ValueSupport`, meaning that it can be a product of both `Continuous` and `Discrete` dimensions, somthing not supported by the standard `Product`. Example
#md using BenchmarkTools, LowLevelParticleFilters, Distributions
#md dt = TupleProduct((Normal(0,2), Normal(0,2), Binomial())) # Mixed value support
#md # A small benchmark
#md ```julia
#md sv = @SVector randn(2)
#md d = Product([Normal(0,2), Normal(0,2)])
#md dt = TupleProduct((Normal(0,2), Normal(0,2)))
#md dm = MvNormal(2, 2)
#md @btime logpdf($d,$(Vector(sv))) # 32.449 ns (1 allocation: 32 bytes)
#md @btime logpdf($dt,$(Vector(sv))) # 21.141 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)
