# How to tune a Kalman filter
This tutorial is [hosted as a notebook](https://juliahub.com/pluto/editor.html?id=ad9ecbf9-bf83-45e7-bbe8-d2e5194f2240).

See also [section 3.3 in "Stochastic Differential Equation Methods for Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Process Regression", Arno Solin](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/server/api/core/bitstreams/aaf7725c-7955-4d21-8d31-e27fdd23c503/content) for how to model temporal Gaussian processes as linear statespace models, suitable for inclusion as disturbance models for Kalman filtering. Many of these Gaussian processes are demonstrated in our [Disturbance gallery](@ref).
